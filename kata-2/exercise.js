  Implement the body of a function that is able to find palindromes in a string.

  Given a string, the output should be similar to the following:

  "Hello" is not a palindrome
  "Madam" is a palindrome

  Extra: Also output if the word is an odd length or not

  Extra: Output an additional message if the word is a special palindrome "noon", or "boob" for example.

  Bonus: Use an environment variable to check if an arbitrary word is a palindrome
